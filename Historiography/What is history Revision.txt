According to Carr [[[what is history]]] and upon what [[[three pillars]]] does his argument stand?

[[[Acton and Clark]]] hold different views of the [[[methodology]]] and [[[writing history]]]. What are those views? How has their [[[own time in history]]] shaped those views?

What is the problem with [[[historical “facts”]]]? Consider the [[[ontology of facts]]]. Are these “impersonal atoms which nothing can alter”? What examples does Carr use to explain the problem of “facts”?

What makes a [[[good historian]]]? How is a good historian compared with a [[[good architect]]]?

What is meant by Lytton Strachey’s claim [[[“ignorance is the first requisite of the historian”]]]?

At face value [[[Carr]]] constructs his case but in the blink of an eye he reveals his own doubts. What [[[counter-argument]]] does he provide to [[[his own argument]]]?

1. What are the [[[problems of history]]]? Address the [[[problems of ontology, epistemology, methodology and ideology]]].

2. How does [[[time and place]]] affect one's understanding of history? Cite many examples. How does this understanding [[[change with time]]]?

3. Give one example of a historical subject (such as an event or person) and show how this subject has been understood and explained [[[in contradictory terms by various historians]]].
What [[[accounts for]]] these contradictions? Is one view more accurate than the other? [[[How do you determine]]] that one side is more [[[accurate]]] than the other? What [[[criteria]]] do you use?

E. H. Carr (1961), What is History

Historian and Facts
    What is history
        Acton
            unique opportunity of recording
            ripest conclusions of international research
            no ultimate history in this generation
            dispose of conventional history -> make problems solvable
        Clark
            commented on Acton: ultimate history is possible
            later generation historians expect their work to be superseded repeatedly
