What is history
    opportunity of recording
    ripest conclusions of international research
    conventional history
    reached point - what?
    problems becomes capable of solution

ultimate history
    belief of Acton and his collaborators
    later generation don't believe
        supersede repeatedly
        history come through minds
            processed
            alterable
    endless exploration
        -> scepticism
        historical judgment : personal view -> no objective truth

1890's -> nonsense, 1950's may neither
    stray beyond history
